# ForKast

ForKast is a user-friendly application designed to facilitate restaurant reviews and recommendations from the food stall in Bloemen building in De La Salle University, offering users a platform to browse reviews from fellow diners and search for restaurants matching their preferences. Unlike broader review platforms like Google, ForkCast focuses exclusively on restaurant reviews, providing a centralized space dedicated to genuine dining experiences and eliminating concerns about defamatory or misleading content. With its social networking features, ForkCast aims to connect users through their shared passion for dining, offering a valuable resource for individuals seeking reliable insights before deciding where to dine.
